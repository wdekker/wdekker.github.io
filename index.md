  <h2>About me</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I’m a Business Architect and former Software Engineer with a passion for innovation, platform engineering, and developer experience.
      I help teams and organizations bridge the gap between business goals and technical execution — whether in large-scale platforms or exploratory innovation projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Rabobank I’ve worked across domains: shaping developer platforms for 8,000+ engineers, guiding the adoption of new ITSM and IDP solutions,
      and now driving innovation in the Wholesale & Rural domain with GenAI, GIS, IoT, and blockchain initiatives.
