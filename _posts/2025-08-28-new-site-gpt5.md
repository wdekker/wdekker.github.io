title: "A New Beginning: Redesigning My Personal Site with GPT-5"
date: 2025-08-28

## A fresh start

You might notice things look a little different around here. That’s because I’ve just launched a completely new version of my personal site — redesigned from the ground up. This time, instead of crafting everything by hand, I experimented with a new way of working: **vibe coding with GPT-5**.  

The idea was simple: treat the AI as a collaborative design and coding partner. Instead of spending hours tweaking layouts or writing CSS from scratch, I guided GPT-5 with prompts, reviewed the results, and iterated quickly. The process felt less like “coding” and more like “directing a creative assistant.”

## How we built it

Here’s a rough overview of the steps and prompts we used to bring this site to life:

1. **Initial direction**  
   - *“I want to redesign my github.io website. Can you help me with this?”*  
   - Outcome: set up a plan for a clean portfolio site with room for a blog.

2. **Look & feel**  
   - *“A clean personal portfolio, with light/dark mode, and a section about me, a photo, and resume.”*  
   - Outcome: generated a custom Jekyll theme (HTML + CSS) with automatic dark/light support.

3. **Adding content**  
   - *“Here’s my photo, can you add it to the design?”*  
   - *“Please generate the full layout and CSS.”*  
   - Outcome: a working prototype with personal branding baked in.

4. **Resume**  
   - *“Can you ask me questions to complete and correct my resume?”*  
   - *[uploaded CV PDF]*  
   - Outcome: distilled a shorter, highlight-focused resume integrated directly into the site.

5. **Blog setup**  
   - *“I want to add some content to the site, the resume and a few blogposts.”*  
   - Outcome: a blog section ready to be filled, starting with this very post.

## Lessons learned

Working with GPT-5 in this “vibe coding” way came with some clear **pros and cons**:

### ✅ Pros
- **Fast iteration:** I could go from idea → prototype → polished result in hours.  
- **Creative sparring partner:** GPT-5 suggested layouts, design choices, and content structures I wouldn’t have come up with alone.  
- **Focus on content:** Instead of fiddling endlessly with CSS, I could focus on what I wanted to say.  

### ⚠️ Cons
- **Encoding gotchas:** Some generated files had hidden BOM characters or spacing that broke Jekyll.  
- **Need for manual polish:** GPT gets you 90% there, but the last 10% (consistency, tone, polish) still needs human touch.  
- **Context juggling:** For bigger projects, it helps to keep track of the conversation and prompts carefully.

## Wrapping up

So here we are: a new site, a new design, and a new way of working.  
This first post felt fitting — not just to celebrate the redesign, but to document the *process* of building it with AI collaboration.  

If you’re curious about the nitty-gritty or want to try vibe coding yourself, feel free to reach out. And of course, more posts are on the way — this time less about *how* the site was built, and more about the themes I’m passionate about: **architecture, developer experience, and innovation.**
